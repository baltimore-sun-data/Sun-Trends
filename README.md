# Sun Trends
<strong><em>Display the most viewed stories in real time</em></strong>

Sun Trends is a tool to track the most-viewed stories on Tribune Publishing websites. It's aim is to replace the most-viewed module which was lost in the company-wide NGUX site redesigns.

Paired with Chartbeat, Trends is a great new way to track what's most popular among readers in real time.
